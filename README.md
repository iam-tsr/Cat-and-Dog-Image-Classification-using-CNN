## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation steps.

Key concepts covered:
- Data preprocessing (rescaling, augmentation)
- Building CNN models with layers such as Convolution, Pooling, and Fully Connected Layers
- Training the model on image data
- Evaluating performance using accuracy and loss metrics

## Model Architecture
The model in this notebook is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to work on image data. The architecture typically includes:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality while retaining important information.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Make predictions based on extracted features.
- **Activation Functions**: Apply non-linearity to enhance the model's learning capacity.

## Local Installation and Setup

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes images of cats and dogs. The dataset can be obtained from the following source:
- [Kaggle Cats vs. Dogs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)

Ensure that the dataset is downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory before running the notebook.

### Installation and Setup
To run this project, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If no `requirements.txt` file is present, the following libraries will likely be needed:
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image handling)
  
You can install these libraries using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python
```

### Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iam-tsr/cats-vs-dogs-classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd cats-vs-dogs-classification
    ```
3. Ensure the dataset is in the correct directory as expected in the notebook.
4. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook cats_v_dogs_classification_modified.ipynb
    ```

Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, build the model, train it, and evaluate its performance.

### Results
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss on both the training and validation datasets. Key performance metrics and visualizations such as accuracy curves and confusion matrices will be displayed in the notebook.
